    <h3>Further Functions</h3>
    <h4>Properties and Methods</h4>
    <p>
        The fact that functions are first class objects means they can have proper properties and methods.

        lets use the square() function that we wrote in chapter 4

        function square(x){
        return x*x;
        }
        If we query the length property we can see that it accepts one parameter.

    <h4>Call and Apply Methods</h4>
    <p>the call() method is used to set the value of this inside a function to an object that is provided
        as the first argument.
        In the following example, the sayHello() function refers to an unspecific object called this that has a
        property,
        property name.

        function sayHello(){
        return`Hello my name is ${this.name}
        }
        we can create some objects that have a name property, then use the call() function to invoke the
        sayHello()function
        providing each object as an argument.
        This will then take the value of this in the function.
        If the function that has been called requires any parameters, these need to be provided as arguments after the
        first argument which is always the value of this.

        Lets update the function sayHello() to give a more generalized greeting

        function sayHello(greeting='Hello'){
        return`${greeting}, my name is ${
        this
        }
        if a function doesn't refer to an object as this in the body, it can still be called using the call()function
        but you need to provide null as its first argument.
        As an example we could call the square() function using the call() method like so:

        square.call(null,4)

        The apply()method works in the same way except the arguments of the function are provided as an array even if
        there's only one argument.

        These two are powerful methods as they allow generalized functions to be written that are not tied to specific
        cobjects
        This provides us the users with the flexibility o f how the functions can be used.

    </p>

    <h3>Custom Properties</h3>
    There is absolutely nothing that can stop you from adding a description inside a function in the same way
    that you can add properties to any object in JavaScript

    <h4>Memoization</h4>
    This is a useful feature because it provides caching or Memoization
    Once a function takes a lot of time to return the value, we can save the result in a cache property.
    If the same argument is used again later then we can load from the cached property.

    for example, we could rewrite the square function so that it saves each result in a cache object that is the result
    of the
    property of the function.

    function square(x){
    square.cache =square.cache|| {};
    if (!square.cache = square.cache[x]){
    square.cache[x = x*x;]
    }
    return square.cache[x]
    }
    </p>
    <P>
    <h4>Immediately Invoked Function Expressions</h4>
    These are sometimes known as IIFFE.
    These are invoked as soon they are defined
    The function also has to made into an expression which is done by placing the whole declaration inside parentheses
    as an example.
    These are also useful way of performing a task while keeping any variables wrapped up within the scope of
    a function.
    this means that the Global name space is not polluted with lots of variable names
    </P>
    <p>
    <h4>Temporary Variables</h4>
    There is no way to remove a variable from a scope on ce it is defined or declared.
    Placing any code that uses IIFFE will ensure its only available while the IIFFE is invoked then it will disappear.

    <h4>Initialization Code</h4>
    An IIFFE can be used to set up any initialization code that there will be no need for again.
    An IIFFE will be invoked once and can set up as many variables as it can at that particular time.
    This can set up any variables, event handlers when the page loads.

    <h4>Functions that define and rewrite themselves</h4>
    The dynamic nature of JavaScript is that a function is not only able to call itself but define itself and even
    redefine itself
    This is done by assigning an anonymus function to a variable that has the same name as the function.
    <h4>Init-Time Branching</h4>
    this technique can be used with the feature detection to create functions that write themselves known as init-time
    This enables functions to work well on their own without engaging the Browser. and avoid checking features every time they are involved

    function ride(){
        if (window.unicorn){
            ride = function(){
                // some code that uses the brand new and sparkly unicorn methods
                return 'Riding on a unicorn is the best!';
            }
            else {
                ride = function(){
                    // some code that uses the older pony methods
                    return ' Riding on a pony is still pretty good';

                }
                return ride 
            }
        }
    }
    after rewriting the function towards th end we will recall it again so that the re written function
    is now invoked and the relevant value returned. One thing to be aware of is that the function is now invoked
     and the relevant value returned.
    Once the function has been invoked its rewritten based on the browser capabilities. We can check this by inspecting the function without invoking it
    
    <h4>Recursive functions</h4>
    This is the function that invokes itself until certain conditions are met.
    This is a useful tool to use when iterate processes are involved.
    a common example is a function that calculates the factorial of a number.

    <h4>Call Back Functions</h4>
    These are used to facilitate event driven asyncronous programming
    One piece of code will be processed at a time
    Instead of waiting for an event  a call back can be used  thats invoked when the event happens.
    Events can be DOM such as click and keypress
    They can also be events such as completion of a file, dat returned from a database, or the result of a complex operation


Heres an example of a function called wait() that accepts a call back. To simulate an operation that takes sometimecto happen  we can use
the setTimeout() function to call the callback after a given number of seconds
function wait(message, callback,seconds){
    setTimeout(callback, seconds *1000);
    console.log(message)
}

Now lets create a callback function
function selfDestruct(){
    console.log('BOOM!');
}
If we invoke the wait()function then log a message to the console we can see how Javascript works asynchronously
When the wait() function is invoked any code inside it is run.
This means that control is handed back to the program and the next line in the program is run.
This demonstrates that the setTimeOut()function did not block the rest of the program.
This is called the JavaScript event-loop .

Remember only one task can happen at a time.

<h4>Call Back Hell</h4>
 The increase in the use  of asynchronous programming in JavaScript has ensure that more and mmore code is used
 This means that the code can be messy and sphaghetti code.
 This is where more than one code is used resulting in a number of nested blocks that are difficult to comprehend
 Call back Hell is therm used to refer  to this tangled mess of code and its such a common issues.

 <h4>Promises</h4>
 This represents the future result of an asynchronously operation. Promises do not do anything
 Promises dont do anything that cant already to be used callbacks but they help simplify the process and avoiid the convoluted code that can
 result from using multiple callbacks.
 A settled promise can result in two different outcomes
 <ol>
    <li>
        Resolved - the asynchronous operation was completed successfully
    </li>
    <li>
        Rejected - the asynchronous operation didnt work as expected wasnt successfully completed or resulted in an error

    </li
    
 </ol>
 Both these outcomes will return in any relevant data. and youy can take the appropriate action based onn the outcome of the promise.
 
 <h4>Creating a Promise</h4>
 A promise is created using a Constructor function. This takes a function called an executor as an argument.
It also accepts two functions as arguments the resolve() function is called if the operation is unsuccessful and the
reject() function is called if the operation fails. The general layout of a promise can be seen in the code below.

const promise = new Promise ((resolve, reject)=>{
    //initialization code comes Here
    if (success){
        resolve(value);
    }
    else{
        reject(error);
    }
})
<h4>Dealing with a Settled Promise</h4>
Once a promise has been settled the then() method can then be used to deal with the outcome.
This methods accepts two arguments. The first is a fulfillment action plan thats called when a promise is resolved.
()
The second argument is a rejection function thats called if the promise is rejected .
The then() and catch() methods can be chained together to form a succint operation of how to deal with the outcome of the promise.
