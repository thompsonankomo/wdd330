        Test and Debugging
    </h1>
    <h2>Errors, Exceptions and warnings</h2>
    <p>
        Normally errors are caused when something gies wring and needs to be fixed.
        Errors are usually caused by one of the following
    <ul>
        <li>


            System Error - this happens when theres a problem with the system or external devices withwhich the cprogram
            is interacting with.
        <li>Programmer Error- these are caused by Programmers They contain incorrect or faulty code. It could be
            something as simple as a typo.</li>
        <li>User Error - this is when the user has entered incorrect data.
        </li>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        As programmers it can be a complex task to fix the code especially the root of the error.
        Programmer errors are our and we should allit takes to make sure that they are eliminated.
        We do this by using simple code that easy to follow and to understand
        User errors we try to alleviate them by making sure we predict any possible interactions that may throw an
        error.
        The programs must be designed in a way that makes the user not amake an error. Thes might be called Programmer
        erros as well.
        .
    </p>
    <h3>Exceptions</h3>
    an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with the error.
    <h4>
        Stack Traces
    </h4>
    <p>
        an exception will also produce a stack trace.
        this is simply a sequence of functions and methods that lead to the origin of the error.
        A stack trace will work backwards from the poiunt at which the error ocuured to identify the original function
        or method that started trhe sequence.

    </p>
    <h3>Warnings</h3>
    <p>
        This can occur if there isnt enough errors to make the program to crush.
        The program can the coninue to run even if theres an error.This can be problematic if it is not solved.
        When a run time error occurs in the browser, the HTML will continue to work but thee JavaScript will stop
        workingin the background.
        If a warning occurs the JavaScript will continue to run although possibly incorrectly.
    </p>
    <h3>Importance of Testing and Debugging</h3>
    <p>
        A programmer should ensure that any mistakes are found in the developmental area so that they can be easily
        fixed.
        When exceptions are caught and dealt with and the code is teseted vigorously it minimizes thepossiblity fo
        almost all of these errors.


    </p>
    <h3>Strict Mode</h3>
    <p>
        Writing code in this mode can help improve its clarity and speed
        Since it follows its conventions, this will throw exceptions if any are used.
        Strcik mode requires this to used at the start of each code at the start "use Strict";
        This will then be picked by any JavaScript engine that uses trict mode.
        If the engine does not support strict mode the string will just be ignored.


    </p>
    <h3>Linting Tools</h3>
    These tools can be used to test the quality fo the JS code.
    Tools like JS Lint, JS Hint, and ES Lint.
    They highlight any slopy programming practices or syntax errors.
    They will complain if certainstykes of programming are not followed like indentantion as an example.
    They are also useful for enforcing a programming style guide and is useful when you are working in Teams as it
    ensures everybody follows the same conventions.
    One option is to install a linting tool on themachine or programming environment.

    </p>
    <h3>Feature Detection</h3>
    <p>
        This is the most recommended way to determine Browser support.
        This is done using an if statement to check whether an object or method exists before trying to call the method.
        This method guarantees that the method is only called if it actually exists and fails gracefully without any
        exceptions being thrown, if the mothod does not exist.
        Modernizr - this is a library that offers any easy way to implement feature detection and Can Iuse? is another
        useful feature resource for checking with features which are currently supported in differnet browsers.


    </p>
    <h2>
        Debugging in the Browser
    </h2>
    <p>
        This is the process of finding out where the bug occurs in the code and then dealing with it.
        Often times the errors in the code do not start where they originate from.
        Its useful to run the progrsam and check to see where errors are highlighted.
        When doing this it iuseful to create breakpoints.
        The Breakpoint halt the progress of the code and allows us to view thevalue of differnet variables at that point
        in the program.
        There are a numbers of ways of Debugging JavaScript code.

    </p>
    <h4>
        The Trusty Alert
    </h4>
    <p>
        The most basic form of debugging is to use the alert() method to show a dialog certain points of the code.
        As an example

        function amIOldEnough(age){
        if (age=12){
        alert(age);
        return "No, sorry.";
        }else if (age<18){ "return only if you are accompanied by an adult" ; } else return "Yep Come In" ; } <p>Using
            alerts was the only option for debugging in the practices
            JavaScript has evolved ever since that and the use of alert methods has been discouraged,
    </p>
    <h3>
        Using the Console
    </h3>
    <p>Most modern JavaScript environments have consoles objects that provide a number of methods for logging
        information and debugging.
    </p>
    <h5>The console.log Method</h5>
    <p>
        we have already seen and used the console.log method()
        this is used to log the values of variables at different stages

    </p>
    <h5>The console.trace()</h5>
    <p>
        This method will log an interactive stack trace in the cosnole
        This will show the functions that were called in the lead up to an exception occuring while the code is running
    </p>
    <h2>Debugging Tools</h2>
    <p>Most modern browsers have a debugging tool that allows to set up breakpoints in your code that will pause at
        certain points.
        One of the most powerful tools is the Debugger Keyword.
        This will create a breakpoint in your code that will pause the xecution of the code and allow you to see what
        the program is currently up to.


    </p>
    <h3>Error Objects</h3>
    <p>an error object can be created by the host environment when the exception occurs or it can be created in a cod
        eusing a constructor function
        const error = new error
        There are seven more error objects used for a specific purpose
        These are
    <ul>
        <li>
            Eval error - This is only retained for backwards compatibility
        <li>RangeError - Is thrown when a number is outside the allowable range of values</li>
        <li>ReferenceError - is thrown whena refernece is made to an item that doesnt exist</li>
        <li>SyntaxError - when there is an orrr in the code syntax</li>
        <li>TypeError -when there is an error in the type of values used</li>
        <li>URIError - is known when there is a problem in encoding and decoding the URL</li>
        <li>InternalError-- no standard error that is thrown when an eror occurs in the Javascript engine</li>
        </li>

    </ul>
    <p>
    All error objects have a number of properties
    </p>
