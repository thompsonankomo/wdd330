   <h2>
    Transforms and Transitions
   </h2>
   <h3>
    Transforms
   </h3>
   <p>
The css3 transform property lets u translate, rotate, scale  and skew any element on the page.
This also give you unprecedented control over many more aspects of the elements appearance.
We can manipulate an elements appearance using transform functions.
<h4>Translation</h4>
These allow you to move elements from left , right, up or down.
They are similar to a behavior of position:'relative=' when declaring top and left or up and down
   along the x and y axes.
   When you employ a translation function you are moving elements without impacting the flow of the document.
   A translated element can only be moved relative to its current position.
the translate (x,y)function moves an element from left and y from the top
transform: translate(45px, -45px)
if you want to move an element vertically you use the translatex function or the translatey functions respectively.
to move up along the y axis by 30px include :
transform: translateY(-30px)
It is important to note that transforms dont work on inline elements

<h4>Scaling</h4>
The scale(x,y) scales and element by the defined factors horizontally then vertically
this is shown by the following transform: scale(1.5,0.25)
As with translate you can use the scaleX and scaleY
A scaled element will grow outwards from or shrink inwards towards its center.
In other words the elements will stay at the same place asi its dimensions change.
To change this you can include the transform origin property
.ad-ad2 h1:hover span{
   color:#484848;
   transform:translatex(40px) scale(1.5);
   Note that a new transform shouldnt be declare because of the cascade, a second transform would override the first.
   To declare multiple transformations we declare the scaling towards the end of that space separated list.
   Its also important to remember that scaling has no issues with the document flow.
   Transforming does not cause a reflow.
   <h4>Rotation</h4>
<p>
   The rotation element rotates a function or an element around the  point of origin by a specified angle value.
   The default origin is the elements  centre.
   Angles are declared in  degrees with positive one going clockwise and the negative ones going anti clockwise.

   .ad-ad2 h1:hover span{
      color:#484848;
      transform:rotate(10deg) translateX(40px)
   
   }
   In the above example we are rotating the span by 10 degrees clockwise-adding to the effect of the text, thats just been dealt a powerful uppercut
   We are declaring the rotation before the translation so that it can be applied first.
   Remember that transforms are applied in the order provided.
   In this case the span will be rotated 10 deg clockwise and then moved 40px along the rotated x axis.
   </p>
   <h1>Transitions</h1>
   Animation ahs certainly been possible wit JavaScript, but native CSS transitions generall require less client-side processing so that they usually appear smoother.
   Transitions allow the values of CSS properties to change overtime essentially providing simple animations
   CSS transitions are declared along with the regualr styles on an element
   Here are the steps to create a simple transition using only css3
   <ol>
      declare the original state of the  element in the default style declaration
      declare the final state of your transitioned element; for example. a:hover state.
      include the transition functions in your default style declarations using the transition properties,  including the transform-property ,the transform-duration,transitions-timing-function and transition delay.

   </ol>

<p>
   <h4>Transition Property</h4>
   This defines the CSS properties of the element that should be transitioned with all of the properties being default.
   You can provide any number of CSS properties to the transition-property declaration, separated by commas,

If you want to transition more than one property but all of them comma-separate them.

<h4>The transition Duration Property</h4>
This sets how long the duration -property, has no effect thats because we will still need to specify the duration fo the transition.

<h4>The transition-timing-property</h4>
<p>
   this lets you control the pace of the transition in even more granular detail.
   the most common timing functions include terms. ease. linear, ease-in, ease-out, or <ease-in-out></ease-in-out>
   The default ease haa slow start and  then speeds up and ends slowly
   linear creates a transition that animates at a constant speed
   Ease-in-out is similar to ease but accelerates more sharply at the beginning.
   the opposite ease-out start at electric speed. then slows progressively as it reaches the conclusion of the transition.

   The best way to familiarize around them is to play around and practice more often until they become second nature.
   In addition to the predefined functions that are set,and developer defined functions also you can divide the transition over the equidistant field
   With the steps function you define any number of steps that you are willing to take and the direction of either start or end.
   for example step(5, start) would jump through the equidistant steps of 0%, 20%, 40%, 60% and 80%
   steps(5,end) would jump through the equidistant steps o 20% 40% 60% 80% and 100%

   <h4>The transiton Delay -property</h4>
By using this it is possible to  introduce a delay before the transition actually happens
Normally a transition begins immidiately so th default is 0.
a 5oms is enough time to make sure that they hover over our advertisement.

<h4>The Transition shorthand property</h4>
The transition Property is shorthand for the four transition properties just described.
.ad-ad2 h1 span{
   transition-property:transform;
   transition-duration:0.2s;
   transitions-timing-function:ease-out;
   transition-delay:50ms;
}
 Now all these are going to be combined in a shorthand syntax
 .ad-ad2 h1 span{
   transition:transform 0.2s ease-out 50ms;
 }
 Note that the properties in shorthand syntax can be in  any order.
 If a delay is included you must also include a  duration and the duration must  precede the delay.

 <h4>Multiple Transitions</h4>
 These allow for multiple transitions in one call.
 If you want your properties to transition at different rates  or if you just want a select few to have a transition effect, include them as a comma separated list containing a minimum, th e transition property and transition duration for each.
 Simple include each value in a comma separated list using the same order as transition property. for all long hand transition properties.
 You can also use the shorthand to specify multiple transitions at different durations delays and timing functions.
 If you want to change both properties at the same rate and delay you can include both property names
 when using all keyword, all the properties transition at the same rate, speed and delay.
 transition:all 0.2s ease-out 50ms

<h1>
   Canvas
</h1>
<p>
   With HTML5's Canvas API we are no longer limited to drawing rectangles on our sites.
   we can draw anything we can imagine all through JavaScript.
   We can draw shapes and lines, arcs, text,gradients and patterns.
   Canvas gives us the power to manipulate pixels in images and even video.
   The Canvas 2D context spec is supported in:
   <li>Safari 2.0+</li>
   <li>Chrome 3.0+</li>
   <li>Firefox 3.0+</li>
   <li>Internet Explorer 9+</li>
   <li>Opera 10+</li>
   <li>iOS(Mobile Safari)1.0+</li>
    <h3>Creating a canvas element</h3>
    <p>
      The first step to creating a canvas element is to create or add a canvas element to the page.
      <canvas>Sorry! your browser doesn't support</canvas>
      the text in between the canvas tags will be shown if the canvas element is not supported.
      Since drawing on the canvas is done using JavaScript, we'll need a way to grab the element from the DOM.
      We'll do so by giving our canvas an id;
      When our page is ready we will call a JavaScript we will start by calling  JavaScript function.
      We will add our JQuery document,ready check toa script element at the bottom of the page.
      <script>$('document').ready(function(){
        draw();}); </script>
      The canvas element takes both a width and a height attribute, which should also be set:
      <canvas id="mycanvas" width="200" height="200">Browser doesn't support canvas</canvas>
      Finally lets add a border to our canvas to visually distinguish it on the page using some CSS.
      Canvas has no default styling, so ist difficult to see where it is on the page unless you give it some kind of border.
      #mycanvas{
         border:dotted 2px black;
      }
      <h3>Drawing on the Canvas</h3>
      all drawing on the canvas happens via the Canvas JavaScript API.
      We have called a function draw()when our page is ready, so lets go ahead and create that function.
      <script>function draw(){
         var canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas")</script>
      <h3>The Canvas Coordinate System</h3>
      <p>The coordinate system in the canvas is a bit different from the cartesian coordinate system we learned in Maths
         In the canvas coordinate system, the top-left corner is(0,0)
         If the canvas coordinate is 200pixels, then the bottom right corner is (200,200)</p>
