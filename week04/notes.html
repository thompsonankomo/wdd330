    <h2>Forms in Javascript</h2>
    <p>
        They are made up of a form element that contains form controlls such as input menus,buttons and submit fields.
        When it comes to forms theres plenty of ussability and correct mark up to do.
    </p>
    <h3>Accessing form elements</h3>
    <p>
        The legacy DOM has a useful attribute called document.forms that returns a collection of all forms
        in the document in the order that they appear in the mark up
        To return a collection of forms we have to use the index notation
        const form = document.forms[0]
        Sometimes instead of using a numerical index we can use the name attribute of the form in order to be able to
        identify it
        const form = document.forms.search;
        Normally in the above example square bracket notaion can be used to avoid confusion in declaring the form.
        const form = document.forms['search'];
    </p>
    <h3>Form Objectives and Methods</h3>
    <p>
        The form.submit() method will submit the form automatically.
        The form.reset() metthod will reset all the form controls back to their intial values specified in the HTML.
        The form.action='/an/other.url'
    </p>
    <h3>Form Events</h3>
    <p>
        The form event occurs when an element is focused upon. In this case of an <input> element, this is when the
        cursor is placed inside an element
        either by clicking or tapping on it or navigating to it using the keyboard.
        const input = form.elements.searchInput;
        input.addEventListener('focus',()=>alert('focused'), false);
        The blur event occurss when the user moves the focus away from the form element after changing it.\
        so if a user clicks in an input field and makes no changes and then clcks elsewhere, the change event wont be
        recognisable but a blur will occurs

    </p>
    <h4>Submitting a Form</h4>
    <p>This is probably the msot importnt event occuring when the form is submitted
        normally this will send the content of the form to the server to be processed.
        We can use JavaScript to intercept the form before its sent by adding a submit event addEventListener
        const form = document.forms['search'];
        form.addEventListener('submit'), search,false);
        function search(){
        alert('form submitted');
        }
        One thing thats imperative to note is that you can prevent the form from submitting to the URL by using
        preventDefault() method
        funtion search(event){
        alert('Form Submitted');
        event.preventDefault();
        }
    </p>
    <h4>
        Retrieving and Changing Values From a Form
    </h4>
    <p>
        Text elements attributes have a value property that can be used to retrieve the text inside the field.
        We can report back what the user has searched for.

        function search(event){
        alert('You Searched for: ${input.value}')
        event.preventDefault();
        }

    </p>
    <h4>
        Form Controls
    </h4>
    <p>
        There are other events that can help to make web pages more interactive
        Some common types of form controls include
        <li>input fields - these include text, passwords, check boxes, radio buttons and file uploads</li>
        <li> select menus for dropdown lists of options</li>
        <li>Text area - elements for longer text entry</li>
        <li> Submit - elemts for submitting and resettings forms</li>
    </p>
    <h2>Input Fields</h2>
    <p>
        These are the most common type of form controlls but there are several types of forms controlls;
    <ol>
        <li>Text Input fields - The default of this input is text which is used for enetering a shortpiece of text such
            as a username</li>
        <li>Password Input Fields - This used to enter peassswords and secret information. It works the sam e way as the
            type=text except the characters are concealed as they are entered so they are unable to be read on the
            screen.
        </li>
        <LI>Checkbox Input Field - They are created using the checkbox type=checkbox. Used to select different options
            that can be checked true or false or left
            The user can select more than one checkbox from the list . Please note that a Checkbox can be set to true
            using JavaScript by settin g its checked property to true</li>


    </ol>
    </p>
    <h3>Radio Button Input fields</h3>
    <p>
        They are created using input fields type= 'radio'. They allow users to check on an option if it is true or not.
        They provide an exclsive array of option so that only one can be selected. Each radio button has a set of rules
        for either true or false
        depending on whether it is selected or not.Rdio buttons can alslo be checked initially using the checkmed
        attribute in the HTML
    </p>

    </p>
    <H3>Hidden Input fields</H3>
    <p>
        Hidden input fields can be created using type='hidden'.
        They arent displayed by the Browser but they have a value attribute that can contain information that is
        submitted with the form
        they are often used to sendx information such as settings or information that the user has already provided.
        The information in this is no way secret as it is visible in the HTML, so this shouldnt be used for sensitive
        data

    </p>
    <h3>File Input fields</h3>
    <p>can be created using input type='file'
        these are used to upload files </p>
    <h3>
        Dropdown Menus
    </h3>
    <p>
        They can be used to selct one or more options from the selecct values
    </p>
    <h3>
        Text Area
    </h3>
    <p>
        A text area element is used to enter long pieces of text over multipe lines such aas a comment or blogpost
        They work in a similar fashion as input fields.

    </p>
    <h3>Buttons</h3>
    <p>
        The default type of a button is submit.
        Another type we have already seen is the reset button whixh willl reset all the form fields to their origianl
        settings
        The other type is simply button. It doesnt need to be inside a form element and has no default behaviour.
        Simply creates a clickable button that can have an eventListener attached to it.
    </p>

<h2>Object Oriented Programing in Javascript</h2>
<p>
    This a style of programming that involves separating the code into objects that have properties and  Methods
    it keeps the related pieces of dcode encapsulated in object thatmaintainstate throughout the  life of the program.
    There are three main concepts of OPP and these are 1( Encapsulation, Polymorphosim and Inheritance)

</p>
<h4>Encapsulation</h4>
<p>The innner functions are kept hidden while the outer workipng parts are visible to the user.
This involves keeping all the Programming logic inside and an object and making methods available to implement fully the methods without the 
outside world knowing how its done</p>
<h4>Polymorphosim</h4>
<p>
This means various objects can share the same method but also have the ability to override shared methods with a more specific implementation
</p>
<h4>Inheritance</h4>
<p
>
    In OPP this means we can take a feature of something that is already working somewhere and implememtnthe same code elsewherere
    We can the improve on its functionality  by adding new properties and methods
</p>
<h4>Classes</h4>
<p>
    This uses a class to define the blueprint of an object. Objects are createdd for instances of classes and inherit all the properties
    and methods of the classes
    Constructor functions can be used to creatw instances of the object
    A mixi method can be used to add properties andmethods from other objects
    Polymorphism allows objects to overide share methods with a specific implementation
    Methods can be borrowed from other  objects.
